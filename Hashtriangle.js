var hash = "#";
function addHash () {
	for (var hash = "#"; hash.length < 8; hash += "#")
	console.log(hash);
	} 
addHash();

//was able to sort this exercise out fairly quickly....initially kept trying to do hash + hash in the last part of for loop because I couldn't understand if I had already defined 'hash' as "#' why couldn't I just do hash + hash
